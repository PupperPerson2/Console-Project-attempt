<p>The visual studio is a platform for text-based coding. To set it up, create a folder and open it with visual studios (code) then start coding!

    <p>
        The console screen is where all your coding work should appear if you want to see how your design is looking so far. This is used so that you can check how a project looks to everyone and change something if nescessary so that you dont have to fix everything at the end. You can open the console screen by clicking on the "Go Live" button at the bottom right corner of your screen. You can use the code "console.log()" to print anything on the console screen.</p>

var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
console.log(full_name);

var a = 20;
var b = 4;

var add = a + b;
console.log(add);

var subtract = a - b;
console.log(subtract);

var multiply = a * b;
console.log(multiply);

var divide = a / b;
console.log(divide);
